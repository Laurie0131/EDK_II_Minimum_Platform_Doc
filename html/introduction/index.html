<p>Firmware plays a critical role in an overall computer system. Due to the complexity of modern computers, firmware is
responsible for intializing increasingly complex hardware with contributions from an increasing number of vendors.</p>
<p>EDK II Minimum Platform is intended to break this complexity down into manageable pieces with well-defined responsibilities such that
a firmware for today’s complex computer systems can be built with consistency and simplicity.</p>
<p>Due to the early execution of firmware, it is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Hardware initialization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Boot flow handoff to an operating system</strong></li>
<li>Platform resiliency - The ability to preserve boot capability and gracefully handle failures.</li>
<li>Platform stability - Configuring the platform such that it is stable.</li>
<li>Platform security - Initialize hardware security features, implement firmware security features, and be written
following industry security best practices.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="design-philosophy">
<h2>Design Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#design-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>EDK II Minimum Platform is designed to serve today’s firmware delivery model in which firmware are typically constructed
from a mix of open and closed source modules with an emphasis on converging common platform code responsibilities
between implementations in open source. Specifically, EDK II Minimum Platform is designed to meet the following objectives:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Define a structure that enables developers to consistently navigate source code, execution flow, and the functional
results of bootstrapping a system.</li>
<li>Enable a minimal platform where minimal is defined as the minimal firmware implementation required to produce a
basic solution that can be further extended to meet a multitude of client, server, and embedded market needs.</li>
<li>Minimize coupling between common, silicon, platform, and board packages.</li>
<li>Enable large granularity binary solutions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What is EDK II Minimum Platform?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">EDK II Minimum Platform is a software architecture that describes how to build firmware that is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Consistent</em> - Predictable boot flow with minimal arbitrary deviation in implementation.</li>
<li><em>Extensible &amp; Minimal</em> - A minimal baseline with only essential functionality open to simple extension.</li>
<li><em>Modular</em> - Easy to re-use firmware code across products and debug, modify, and understand.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><em>Scalable</em> - Applies to small embedded systems to multi-socket servers across the platform development</dt>
<dd>lifecycle from pre-silicon work to product derivatives.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The software architecture is implemented in the edk2-platforms Git repository. The implementation consists of the
following pieces:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Minimum Platform package (MinPlatformPkg) - A common set of platform boot flow code that implements the
EDK II Minimum Platform Specification. The code in this package depends upon a set of board APIs. For example, the flow in MinPlatformPkg
may request that the board perform  GPIO initialization. The board package is responsible for implementing the
board-specific detection routine.</li>
<li>Board package - Board-specific code that implements the board APIs described in the EDK II Minimum Platform Specification.</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">EDK II Minimum Platform supports the UEFI Platform init</p>
</dd>
<dt>What platforms are supported by EDK II Minimum Platform?</dt>
<dd>The platforms supported by EDK II Minimum Platform are quickly growing! Because firmware is board-specific, each motherboard must
have compatibility listed. The latest supported boards are listed in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/Platform/Intel/Readme.md#edk-ii-minimum-platform-firmware-for-intel-platforms">Readme.md</a>.</dd>
<dt>What license does EDK II Minimum Platform use?</dt>
<dd>EDK II Minimum Platform is released under a BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/License.txt" target="_blank">License</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Who are the maintainers of EDK II Minimum Platform?</dt>
<dd>Intel maintains the open source code on GitHub. Individual code maintainers are listed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/Maintainers.txt">Maintainers.txt</a>.</dd>
<dt>What are options to debug EDK II Minimum Platform?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">EDK II Minimum Platform supports a variety of debugging techniques. The exact debug capability depends upon the particular
board being debugged. In general, the following are some common techniques used for enabling new platforms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debug message serial UART output</li>
<li>Main memory (DRAM) debug buffer</li>
<li>POST code output</li>
<li>Source level debugging (e.g. using the Intel UEFI Development Kit (UDK) tool via UART or USB3</li>
</ul>
<p>For closed chassis systems whose I/O options for firmware debug are particularly limited, the following
drivers have been developed:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>HDMI debug output. Debug messages are sent over the I2C pins that are traditionally
used to send Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) to a monitor.</li>
<li>SPI flash writeback debug output. Debug messages in a ring buffer fashion to a small area on the SPI flash.
The messages be read back using a flash programmer after the system is powered off.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Is Embedded Controller (EC) supported?</dt>
<dd>No. Different boards may have different EC or SuperIO. Developers need implement the code for the target board.</dd>
<dt>What operating systems are supported?</dt>
<dd>As a UEFI compliant firmware, in general, operating systems that support UEFI are supported. However, hardware
initialization and handoff can vary across operating systems so each board firmware should explicitly mention
which operating systems are supported by that board firmware.</dd>
<dt>What tool chains are supported to compile EDK II Minimum Platform?</dt>
<dd><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>EDK II Minimum Platform supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and GNU GCC toolchains (gcc 5 or newer). Additional tools including</dt>
<dd>Python (3.7), nasm, and IASL are required to build EDK II Minimum Platform.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="last">Additional instructions for building the EDK II open source project are described in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Getting-Started-with-EDK-II">Getting Started with EDK II</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Does EDK II Minimum Platform support verified boot?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Not at this time. As verified boot is not considered essential for basic boot to an operating system, it is
considered an “advanced feature” in the Minimum Platform architecture. This advanced feature has not been created
and fully tested yet.</p>
<p>This feature was not prioritized in the initial set of advanced feature deployment as most users creating firmware
for their motherboard using Minimum Platform do not have access to the OEM signing key such that their firmware can
be verified.</p>
<p class="last">The feature is planned for the future.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does EDK II Minimum Platform support measured boot?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Not at this time. As measured boot is not considered essential for basic boot to an operating system, it is
considered an “advanced feature” in the Minimum Platform architecture. This advanced feature has not been created
and fully tested yet.</p>
<p>This feature was not prioritized in the initial set of advanced feature deployment to focus on base functionality
and features that can help users more easily build and debug firmware for their motherboards.</p>
<p class="last">The feature is planned for the future.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does EDK II Minimum Platform support SMM?</dt>
<dd>EDK II Minimum Platform does support SMM. For some UEFI features on x86 architecture such as UEFI variables, SMM is considered a key
security technology to provide a ubiquitous isolated execution environment within the architecture.</dd>
<dt>Does EDK II Minimum Platform support splash screen?</dt>
<dd>Yes. By default, the TianoCore project splash screen is typically displayed. This can be configured and enabled or
disabled based on platform performance requirements.</dd>
<dt>Does EDK II Minimum Platform support legacy boot?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">EDK II Minimum Platform currently does not support option ROM or CSM mode.</p>
<p class="last">There are no plans to support CSM mode in the Intel open source platforms.</p>
</dd>
